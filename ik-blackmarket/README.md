# ik-blackmarket (Reworked by Greenlife)

## 🔥 Greenlife Black Market - Enhanced & Expanded

Originally created by **ik-blackmarket**, this version has been fully reworked and expanded by **Greenlife**. Full credit to IK for the base — we’ve kept the name as a nod of respect. This version brings new features, optimization, and user-focused improvements while maintaining the gritty edge of the underground economy.
